Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling a loan approval dataset. The primary objectives include:

Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
Training various machine learning models.
Evaluating model performance.
Performing clustering analysis.
Ensuring fairness and reliability in predictions.
Visualizing and interpreting the results.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants, including their demographic details, income, loan amount requested, and loan approval status.

Data Preprocessing
Filled missing values for categorical columns using the mode.
Filled missing values for numerical columns using the median.
One-hot encoded categorical variables.
Standardized numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Correlation matrix heatmap to understand relationships between numerical variables.
Visualization of gender distribution in loan approvals.
Fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR) for gender.
Model Training and Evaluation
Trained and evaluated the following models:

Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for SVM. Additionally, polynomial features and PCA were explored to enhance model performance.

Clustering Analysis
Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
Performed K-Means clustering to identify patterns in the data.
Conducted hierarchical clustering and plotted a dendrogram.
Analyzed loan approval rates per cluster.
Uncertainty Estimation
Used Random Forest to estimate prediction uncertainty. Calculated uncertainty as the standard deviation of predicted probabilities from each tree in the ensemble.

Feature Importance
Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret feature importance and understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.

Results
The results include:

Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Optimal hyperparameters for SVM.
Visualization of clusters and hierarchical clustering.
Loan approval rates per cluster.
Prediction uncertainties.
Feature importance summary plot.

Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of thorough data preprocessing, model evaluation, and fairness considerations in machine learning. The clustering analysis and uncertainty estimation provide additional insights into the data and model predictions.
